Testing animation states and interacting with basic physics objects

In this project, you control a bat character which can fly and carry physics objects.

Controls:
  Arrow keys: move around
  Z: flap wings, which causes a 'jump' to occur. Can keep pressing to fly higher and higher
     holding down the Z button while in the air will cause you to glide slowly to the ground
  X: hold to grab on to objects at your feet. Flapping while holding objects will lift them
